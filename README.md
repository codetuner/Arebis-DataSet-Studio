# Arebis-DataSet-Studio

## Project Description

An ADO.NET DataSet viewer and editor. View and edit XML serialized datasets easily.

## Introduction

Later versions may include creation of datasets or modifying the schema of a dataset.

## Getting Started

Start the application, then choose File/open to open an XML dataset file, or drag&drop the XML dataset file on the application.
